# International Debt Analysis
This short project involved analyzing international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset includes information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The goal of this project was to understand the total amount of debt owed by countries, the countries with the highest debt, and the different areas in which countries may be indebted. The analysis was done using SQL queries. This project was completed as part of a learning experience on DataCamp.
